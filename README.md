# ASTRIS

The Autonmous Spacecraft Testing via Rendezvous, Imaging and Simulation (ASTRIS) project is an open-source methodology with open-source material to conduct simulated closed-loop autonomous spaceraft navigation with hardware-in-the-loop, model-in-the-loop, and sofware-in-the-loop.

The open-source material includes the following:

- Full software suite for operation.
- Two datasets.
- Pre-trained models.
- CAD model.
- Simulator.
- Set-up instructions.
- Hardware set-up instructions.
